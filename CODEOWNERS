# GitHub code owners definitions

# We're managing code reviews / ownership as specified in the LLVM Code Owners
# Policy (https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#code-owners).
# Specifically, the owner is not necessarily responsible for the review itself
# just ensuring the it is appropriately reviewed.

# Dialect/<DialectName> will match both that directory under /include and /lib
